# Image-Steganography


This project implements image steganography, a technique that hides secret information within an image. The hidden information can be text, another image, or any other type of data. This README provides an overview of the project and instructions for usage.

## How it Works

The image steganography process involves embedding the secret data within the pixels of an image. This is achieved by modifying the least significant bits of the pixel values, which are generally imperceptible to the human eye. The process consists of two main steps:

1. Embedding: In this step, the secret data is encoded and embedded into the image by modifying the pixel values.
2. Extraction: The hidden data is extracted from the modified image by decoding the altered pixel values.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the image steganography project:

- Python 
- PIL library
